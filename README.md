# Mutual Authentication client library

This library is a wrapper for libcurl + kerberos*. It abstracts the mutual authentication and encryption details and uses the libcurl to send the desired requests.

*Well, Dojot does not use the Kerberos protocol itself, but a protocol simplified inspired in.

## How to build

Please, follow the instruction under the directories:
- libaes;
- kerberos.

## How to use

An example application can be found under kerberos/example.
